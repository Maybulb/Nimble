<img align="right" width="20%" style="float:right;padding:20px;" src="https://github.com/madebybright/madebybright.github.io/raw/master/img/nimble/256.png">

A Wolfram|AlphaÂ® menu bar application, built with the wonderful [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/).

For the Xcode (Swift) build of the same name, see [Nimble-Swift](https://github.com/madebybright/Nimble-Swift).

## Development
Electron and gulp required to be installed on your machine. Clone the repository, install dependencies, run gulp, then run electron in the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/madebybright/Nimble.git

# cd into the directory and install dependencies
cd Nimble && npm install

# Compiles Sass and starts (gulp && electron .)
npm start
```
