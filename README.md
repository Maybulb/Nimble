![thank you jamie](http://i.imgur.com/LaNbLd2.png)

An extremely proud and distuinguished Wolfram|AlphaÂ® OS X menu bar app coming spectacularly soon.

## Development
Te (we might just change the name back to Nimble at this point) won't be totally bundled for a bit, but it'll still be worked on. You should try get it working on your system, and add something cool while you're at it.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:madebybright/te
cd te
npm install
gulp
electron .
```
