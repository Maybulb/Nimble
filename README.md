Nimble
==

(Tech Teen Voice) An opinionated Wolfram|AlphaÂ® OS X menu bar, built with the wonderful [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/). For the Xcode (Swift) build of the same name, see [Nimble-Swift](https://github.com/madebybright/Nimble-Swift).

## Development
Nimble won't be bundled as an app for a bit but it'll still be worked on. You should try get it working on your system, and add something cool while you're at it.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:madebybright/nimble
cd Nimble
npm install
gulp
electron .
```

## Checklist
- [ ] Convert all JS to Coffee (this seems unnecessary)
