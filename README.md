Nimble
======
<img align="right" width="20%" style="float:right;padding:20px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madebybright/Nimble/master/assets/512.png">

The cross-platform personal assistant that just works. Built with the wonderful [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), as well as many useful libraries. [Follow us on Twitter for updates](https://twitter.com/madebybright).

For the Xcode (Swift) build of the same name, see [Nimble-Swift](https://github.com/madebybright/Nimble-Swift).

## Development
Electron and gulp required to be installed on your machine (`npm install -g electron-prebuilt gulp`). You'll also need a [Wolfram Alpha API Key](http://products.wolframalpha.com/api/).

Clone the repository, install dependencies, then run gulp.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/madebybright/Nimble.git

# cd into the directory and install dependencies
cd Nimble && npm install
```

Create `src/js/key.json` for your key.

```js
{
  "api": "KEY"
}
 ```

Run electron in the project directory to get it up and running.

```
# Compiles Sass and starts (gulp && electron .)
npm start
```

## Packaging/Bundling
If you'd like to package Nimble as an app, or bundle it as a DMG, you can use our gulp tasks.

```bash
gulp package # nimble -> .app
gulp bundle # .app -> .dmg
```

If you're bundling it, make sure to package it beforehand so that the `.app` exists for the disk image.

## Checklist
- [x] Fix overflow problem

- [x] Add search button
- [x] Clean up request
- [x] Improve file structure/skeleton
- [x] Right click icon to exit

- [x] Always offer a link to the Wolfram|Alpha page at the bottom

## Far Future Additions
Some ideas we've been kicking around that we think might have a spot in future versions of Nimble once we've actually gotten it working.

- Quick timezone conversions (possibly with Moment.js)
- Possible natural language for simple queries
